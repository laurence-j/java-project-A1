Assignment 1 of Compsci 230 has taken me approximately 5 days to complete. 

I found the first four questions (Q1-Q4) to be quite easy once I understood the concepts as these four questions were quite similar in design.
Furthermore, I found both Q5 and Q6 to be the most difficult as they included new concepts which were harder for me to understand as I had to learn 
how to utilise Java graphics tools (i.e. Area and Intersect method). 

The topics in Compsci230 which this assignment best helped me to understand is Object Oriented Programming (OOP), Abstract data types, and GUI design.

During the completion of my assignment I have found piazza to be extremely useful and helpful.
